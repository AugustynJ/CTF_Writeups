# Cake CTF 2023

> Welcome to CakeCTF 2023! CakeCTF 2023 is a Jeopardy-style Capture The Flag competition hosted by yoshiking, theoremoon, and ptr-yudai. There will be challenges in categories such as pwn, web, rev, crypto, etc. The challenges are of a difficulty level targeting beginner to intermediate players.
This year we have reduced the difficulty level and the number of challenges a little more than in previous years. Advanced players are encouraged to participate solo or in teams with a couple of people.
